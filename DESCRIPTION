Title: Standardizing data structure, analysis code & reporting for experimental data of between groups comparisons in replication projects
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jens Fuenderich
Maintainer: Jens Fuenderich <Jens.Fuenderich@uni-erfurt.de>
Description: The MetaPipeX framework is a reaction to the diversity in reporting standards
    and data formats in multi-lab replication projects. It serves as a proposal to
    standardize the data structure, analysis code and reporting for experimental
    data of between groups comparisons in replication projects. MetaPipeX consists
    of three components: A descriptive pipeline for data transformations and
    analyses, analysis functions that implement the pipeline and a Shiny App that
    utilizes the standardized structure to allow various insights into the data
    produced by the pipeline. While the framework maps most easily to direct
    replications, its scope may be broadened to conceptual replications and similar
    projects. Illustrations of the pipeline and the functions are available on
    github in the Graphics folder:

    The MetaPipeX R-package provides a readily available set of functions to run the
    standardized part of the pipeline. The package includes three analysis functions
    that each represent a step in the MetaPipeX pipeline
    (create_replication_summaries, merge_replication_summaries and meta_analyses)
    and a fourth that runs the pipeline, starting at person level data
    (full_pipeline). Further, it includes a function that runs the Shiny App
    (MetaPipeX::ShinyApp). All meta-analyses use metafor::rma.mv (Viechtbauer, 2010).
