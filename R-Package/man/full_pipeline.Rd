\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or list of data frames that contain the individual participant data. The function expects the relevant columns to be named consistently across all list objects. Relevant to this function are columns that represent information on the multi-lab (e.g., Many Labs 2), the MASC (meta-analytical-site-collection; e.g., Ross1), the data collection site (the lab a data point is assigned to), the group (either the treatment or control condition) and the single data point of the dependent variable (DV) per person. A template of this data frame is available on \href{https://github.com/JensFuenderich/MetaPipeX/blob/main/Supplementary_Material/Table_Templates/lvl1_individual_participant_data/IPD_template.csv}{{github}}, as is a \href{https://github.com/JensFuenderich/MetaPipeX/blob/main/Supplementary_Material/Table_Templates/lvl1_individual_participant_data/codebook_for_individual_participant_data.csv}{{codebook}} for unambiguous identification of the abbreviations.}

\item{MultiLab}{Character vector with the name of the columns in the list elements of "data" that contain the project name(s). If \emph{is.null(Project) == TRUE}, "Project" is chosen as the default.}

\item{MASC}{Character vector with the name of the columns in the list elements of "data" that contain the meta-analytical-study-collections (MASCs) name(s). If \emph{is.null(Data_Collection_Site) == TRUE}, "MASC" is chosen as the default. Each MASC comprises a single target effect with implementations across multiple sites (/labs).}

\item{Data_Collection_Site}{Character vector with the name of the columns in the list elements of "data" that contain the site names (usually the name of the lab). If \emph{is.null(Data_Collection_Site) == TRUE}, "Data_Collection_Site" is chosen as the default. The meta-analyses in MetaPipeX::meta_analyses() and MetaPipeX::full_pipeline() are run as random effects models in metafor::rma.mv() with “random = ~ 1 | Data_Collection_Site”. Thus, the pipeline assumes a distribution of true statistics (e.g., treatment means, mean differences, standardized mean differences).}

\item{DV}{Character vector with the name of the columns in the list elements of "data" that contain the (aggregated) dependent variable. If \emph{is.null(DV) == TRUE}, "DV" is chosen as the default.}

\item{Group}{Character vector with the name of the columns in the list elements of "data" that contain the (treatment/control) group identification. If \emph{is.null(Group) == TRUE}, "Group" is chosen as the default. These should only contain values of 0 (control group), 1 (treatment group) and NA (unidentified).}

\item{output_path}{Specify the output path for the full documentation of the MetaPipeX pipeline. For an example of the exported structure please refer to the \href{https://github.com/JensFuenderich/MetaPipeX/tree/main/Supplementary_Material/Table_Templates}{{github repository}}. If no folder is specified, the function will return its output only to the R environment (unless this is suppressed under suppress_list_output).}

\item{folder_name}{Optional character string to assign a custom name to the output folder. When folder_name is not specified, the folder name is set to “MetaPipeX_Output”.}

\item{suppress_list_output}{Logical. FALSE by default. If FALSE, the function will return a list output to the environment, containing the site summaries and the codebook. If TRUE, these are not returned to the environment.}

\item{method}{Optional argument to specify the estimation method of the meta-analyses (the default is “REML”). For more information, please refer to the documentation of the metafor package.}

\item{sparse}{A logical indicating whether sparse matrices should be used.}
}
\value{
The output is a nested list object that represents the folder structure that is available under LINK EINFUEGEN

This function is built on four MetaPipeX functions (summarize_sites, merge_site_summaries, meta_analyze_MASCs, create_MetaPipeX_format). As input it expects the same specifications as the summarize_sites function. This function performs all standardized computational steps (3-6) of the MetaPipeX pipeline. For more details on the pipeline, refer to the documentation of the MetaPipeX-package.

## General notes on the pipeline

The MetaPipeX pipeline is a tool to provide structure to the meta-analytical-analyses of multi-lab MASCs. A flowchart that depicts the whole process is available on \href{https://github.com/JensFuenderich/MetaPipeX/tree/main/Supplementary_Material}{{github}}
The yellow blocks with rounded corners are .csv files. The purple/white rectangles each refer to a step in the pipeline that is performed by a MetaPipeX function. MetaPipeX::full_pipeline() performs the steps 3-6 and returns "meta_pipe_x_data.csv" which may be provided to the MetaPipeX App for handy data selection and basic plotting of the analysis results.
Pleasre refer to github for \href{https://github.com/JensFuenderich/MetaPipeX/tree/main/Supplementary_Material/Table_Templates}{{an example of the MetaPipeX Output structure}}.

## full_pipeline

This function executes the pipeline as follows:

\itemize{
 \item{MetaPipeX::summarize_sites()} \cr
 \item{MetaPipeX::merge_site_summaries} \cr
 \item{MetaPipeX::meta_analyses()} \cr
 \item{merging site- and meta-level data to achieve MetaPipeX data format} \cr
}
}
\examples{

# create IPD for 10 MASCs (all from the same MultiLab)
sim_out <- mapply(MetaPipeX::simulate_IPD,
                  MASC_index = 1:5,
                  seed = 50 + (0:(5-1)),
                  SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
# rename list elements (the individual MASCs)
names(sim_out) <- paste("MASC", 1:5, sep = "")

# run the full pipeline
MetaPipeX::full_pipeline(data = sim_out)
